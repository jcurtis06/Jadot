# Jadot ðŸŽ®
I've always loved Java, and I've also always loved the Godot game engine... so I decided to remake Godot in Java. It features many of the same functionalities, with Node-based trees. Currently, this project is in a very early state. Many things are probably going to be changed. Check the wiki for tutorials if you want to use this pile of garbage :)

## Examples
